# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship (Mandatsverhältnis)
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer (Rechtsanwalt/Rechtsanwältin), legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice (Berufshaftung)
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Österreichischer Rechtsanwaltskammertag (ÖRAK) and regional bar chambers (Rechtsanwaltskammern) must comply with applicable professional conduct rules (Berufsordnung) when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules (Standesrecht) require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (RIS — Rechtsinformationssystem des Bundes, ris.bka.gv.at)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force (in Geltung) and has not been amended (novelliert)
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting case law (Judikatur) and explanatory materials (Erläuterungen, Materialien) for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official Austrian legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **RIS (ris.bka.gv.at)** | Authoritative | Statute text, court decisions (primary reference) |
| **Community/open-data sources** | Supplementary | Cross-references, metadata (verify independently) |
| **EUR-Lex / treaty databases** | Authoritative for EU/international law | EU directives, regulations, international obligations |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- RDB (Rechtsdatenbank), LexisNexis Austria, Manz Onlinebibliothek

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive annotations (Kommentierungen), and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- Austrian law changes continuously through new statutes (Gesetze), amendments (Novellen), and court decisions (Entscheidungen)
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl)
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position (aktuelle Rechtslage)

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended (novelliert) after the last database update
  - Repealed (aufgehoben) but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional rules (Übergangsbestimmungen) affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law** -- Coverage of OGH, VwGH, VfGH, and lower court decisions is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research (Judikaturrecherche)
2. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording (Fassungsvergleich)
3. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial annotations (Kommentare), academic commentary (Lehre), or practice guides
4. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative rulings (Bescheide) largely absent
5. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of parliamentary materials (Regierungsvorlagen, Ausschussberichte, Erläuterungen)

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without commentary (Kommentierung) and legislative materials, interpretation may be incorrect
- **International Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess EU law obligations or international treaty compliance

## No Warranties

### "AS IS" -- No Guarantees

Per the Apache 2.0 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

- **NO WARRANTY OF ACCURACY**: Data may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information

  - Professional malpractice claims (Berufshaftungsansprüche)
  - Lost cases or adverse judgments
  - Client harm from erroneous advice

## AI-Generated Content

This Tool uses **algorithmic search and ranking** that may:

- Return irrelevant or misleading results
- Miss critical provisions
- Rank less relevant provisions higher than more relevant ones
- Make errors in parsing, citation formatting, or cross-referencing

**Human review is MANDATORY** before relying on any AI-generated search results or analysis.

## EU AI Act Compliance

This Tool is a **general-purpose AI system** under the EU AI Act. It is NOT a high-risk "administration of justice" system (which applies to AI used by courts and prosecutors for case outcomes).

- **Query Data**: Queries made through the Claude API may be logged by Anthropic (subject to their privacy policy)
- **Client Information**: Do not include client names, case-specific details, or confidential information in queries

- Exercise independent legal judgment (eigenverantwortliche Prüfung)
- Conduct thorough legal research using authoritative sources
- Stay current with legal developments
- Provide competent representation (sorgfältige Mandatsführung)

## Recommended Workflow for Professional Use

1. **Initial Research**: Use Tool for preliminary research and hypothesis generation
2. **Official Verification**: Cross-check ALL results with official sources (RIS — ris.bka.gv.at)
3. **Commercial Databases**: Use professional legal databases (RDB, LexisNexis Austria) for authoritative, annotated versions
4. **Professional Judgment**: Apply independent legal analysis and professional judgment
5. **Document Sources**: Cite official sources in legal work, not this Tool
6. **Update Check**: Before finalizing legal work, check for recent amendments and decisions
